# SVG-Logo-Maker

## Description

ABOUT THIS APPLICATION:
I wanted to create an easy-to-use program that accepts user input to generate a logo. This program will automatically generate an SVG file that contains a user identified shape, text with three characters, and colors for the shape, text, and background color. The user enters their desired colors and shapes by answering the prompts generated by npm inquirer. This application will simplify the logo generation process. 
Building this application taught me how to create tests for my code using Jest. Additionally, I learned more about Object-oriented programming and how it can contribute to the DRY programming paradigm. Classes are useful when working with many kinds of data. 

USER STORY: 
AS a freelance web developer
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA: 
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
